    <p class ="tab">Independent photography. Using Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom I can adjust the colors to be more exact. This works well on RAW files but some photos were in JPG format, these photos turned out well without editing. The ferris wheel and purple sky are in raw format while the toucan and Sprite can are in jpg format.</p>
