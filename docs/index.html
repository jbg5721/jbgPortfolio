        <p class="tab">Hello I am Joey Gardiner, I am a film-set crew member, web designer, and character artist. In film I specialize in camera operation, lighting and gear management. I am a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology major at Penn State Behrend. I have always had an interest in art and I have been creating art for as long as I can remember. It wasn't until high school and onward where I started to develop and expand my skills onto the digital medium.</p>
        <p>In this web portfolio I display a wide range of digital projects I have created and worked on, as well as my resume.</p>
