            <p class="disTex">My team had the idea to create a short film using a script/story generated by an AI. These types of generated stories always have a touch of randomness that are unexpected and end up being pretty funny so we wanted to run with this plan. We used the boredhumans.com website to create the script/story and we took it from there. We had to write the dialogue ourselves and iron out the vagueness of some scenarios.</p>

            <p class="disTex">Experimenting with video art. Through the Behrend Open Lab for Digital Creations (BOLD-C) I had access to professional grade film equipment. I learned how to use the Blackmagic 4k film camera, the RED Dragon 6k film camera, lights, greenscreens, and using Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere in the post-production stage. </p>

            <p class="disTex">Project Statement:
                The video starts off with several scenes and nothing seems to be wrong. But the character has a suspicion that something is off. They die in the nightmare and wake up shaken but they don't quite remember what happened, the nightmare repeats into real life.<br/><br/> Song: Heartbeat of the hood from YouTube Audio Library</p>

            <p class ="disTex">I used a 360 camera in a cardboard and paper scene to create a 3-dimensional space. I was then able to animate onto this 3D space. The viewer can orbit around the scene.</p>
