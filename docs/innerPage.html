    <h2>Video Art</h2>
    <p class="tab">Through the Behrend Open Lab for Digital Creations (BOLD-C) I had access to professional grade film equipment. I learned how to use the Blackmagic Production camera 4k, the RED Epic Dragon camera 6k, lighting systems, audio equipment, greenscreens, and using Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere in the post-production stage.</p>

                    My team had the idea to create a short film using a script/story generated by an AI. These types of generated stories always have a touch of randomness that are unexpected and end up being pretty funny. We used the boredhumans.com website to create the script/story, generated a story we liked and worked from there. We had to write the dialogue ourselves and iron out the vagueness of some scenes.

                    Funkside Forest is a song I developed on GarageBand and I wanted to try my hand at creating a music video. I imagined the main focus being a neon party happening in the woods, so I wrote a script starting with the character on a skateboard and heading to the forest to meet with some friends. Once together they ignite their neon lightsabers and start the party.

                    This short film features my adventures of learning to cook by myself. During this experience I learned pretty quickly that being the subject and the crew is very difficult.

                    While hiking I discovered abandoned debris overgrown with plantlife. I shot the scene using low angles to capture the detail and difference of the debris and plantlife. While editing I found it difficult to work with the footage until I learned of Adobe Premiere color space settings. The color space the footage was in was different to the setting in Premiere, once they were made the same it was much easier to edit and work with.

            <p class="disTex">Project Statement:
                The video starts off with several scenes and nothing seems to be wrong. But the character has a suspicion that something is off. They die in the nightmare and wake up shaken but they don't quite remember what happened, the nightmare repeats into real life.<br/><br/> Song: Heartbeat of the hood from YouTube Audio Library</p>
